## Workday
Workday is a SaaS (https://www.workday.com/) used by many companies to manager their work-force.
It can emit data about the work-force (such as who's an employee and their attributes) through a reporting system.

We provide a sample list of fields to be used by the CIS (Change Integration System) in other to integrate these into the user profile.
